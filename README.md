## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
 Timely delivery is important because:
 1.It ensures client satisfaction-Meeting deadlines ensures that clients are saistfied and their business needs addressed promptly.
 2.It creates team morale-Edhering to deadlines boosts team norale and prevents burnout.
 3.Business value-Preventing delays ensures there is no missed opportunities ,revenue loss and decreased competitiveness.
 Project managers ensures deadlines are met by;
 1.Having a realistic plan-Creating detailed project plans that have achievable timelines.
 2.Allocating resources-Ensuring each project has enough resources to avoid bottlenecks along the way.
 3.Having effective communication-Ensuring they maintain open communication wioth stakeholders and address issues promptly.
 4.Managing risks-Identify and mitigating potential risks that could impact timelines.
 5.Having a change managment structure-Having a process in which change is managed to prevent delays.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control contribute to the success of the project by:
1.Financial viability- This ensures that the project stays within the budget.
2.Resource optimization-This helps allocate the resources efficiently and prevent waste.
3.Client satisfaction-Maintaing the budget increases trust from the client and leaves them satisfied.
Budget overruns can be prevented by;
1.Accurate estimation- Conducting thorough estimation at the beginning of the project.
2.Regular monitoring- Track expenses closely and identify potential overruns early.
3.Contingency planning-Allocate funds for unexpected costs.
4.Value engineering-Evaluating the project components to identify cost-saving opportunities.
5.Change control-Having the ability to manage changes carefully to avoid unplanned costs.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile
It is an iterative incremental approach to project management and software developmement.
It emphasizes on flexibility,collaboration and customer feedback.
Advantages
1.Quick response to changes
2.Regular customer feedback
3.improved team collaboration

Disadvantages
1.	Less predictability
2.	Requires significant customer involvement.

WATERFALL
It is linear and sequential approach and each phase to be completed before the next begins

Advantages
1.clear structure and documentation
2.Easy to manage and track process

Disadvantage
1.Difficult to accommodate changes
2.Testing occurs late in the process

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial when building complex and uncertain projects for example,a new mobile app that has an evolving user interface.
Waterfall is more beneficial when building a well defined project that is unlikely to change and that requires adherence to strict regulation,for example a health management system.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods of ensuring quality assurance;
1.Testing
2.Continuous integration
3.Static Analysis
5.Code reviews
Importance of maintaining high standards.
1.It helps meet client satisfaction
2.It increases reliability
3.It builds a good reputation 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope contributes to successful project planning through;
a) Defining clear objectives that ensures everyone understands the project goals
b) Allocating resources effectively
c) Ensures cost control by preventing scope creeps and associated cost increases.
d) Enables time management through accurate projact scheduling.
A Work Breakdown Structure  is a project management tool that takes a step-by-step approach to complete large projects with several moving pieces.
A WBS is useful because;
a) It divides a project into smaller,manageable tasks.
b) It provides a clear structure for project planning and execution.
c) It helps facilitate the monitoring of project progress
d) It helps in resource allocation.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
The benefits of a detailed project schedule include;
1.It helps in allocating resources effectively.
2.It helps provide a clear overview of project timelines.
3.It helps identify potential bottlenecks and delays
4.It helps in progress tacking allowing the monitoring of project progress against the plan.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The core issues the Software aims to address
1.Limited access to medical specialists-Kenya has a limited specialists for rare and terminal illness;the software aims to bridge that gap by connecting patients to a range of specialits globally.
2.Reduce the travel burden to other countries-Telemedicine eliminates the need for travel  for consultaion enhancing accessibility and affordability.
3.To create a community for patients with rare conditions- Having a rare condition or a family member with a rare condition is challenging,the software also aims to boild a community of people with similar conditions globally.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem halps in understanding the spacific challenges faced by your audience,allowing one to to design features that directly address their needs.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It is a platform that connects kenyan patients with international doctors specializing in complex illnesses.The platform facilitates remote consultations,allowing patients to receive expert care from anywhere in the world,while fostering a supportive online community for those facing similar challenges.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
1.Specialized doctor matching.
2.Telemedicine intergration.
3.Translation services
4.Patient support community
5.Medical records management
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Despite the Kenya telehealth data on terminal illnesses being rare,reports both from Kenya Telehealth and Global Telehealth suggests an increase in adoption of telemedicine for terminal illness making the market promising.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding the market trends will help in;
1,Focusing on specializations that are shortstaffed or non-existent in the country.
2.Target partnerships with international medical institutions.
3. Align features that directly address regional needs.
